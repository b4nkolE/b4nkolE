## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a backend-focused software developer with a growing interest in **scalable systems**, **clean architecture**, and how **real-world applications are structured and maintained**.

My current focus is on building APIs and backend services using modern tools while developing the discipline to write **clean, readable, and maintainable code**.

I care deeply about understanding *why* systems are designed a certain way — not just making things work, but making them **work well at scale**.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- JavaScript for backend development  
- Building APIs with **Express.js**  
- Working with **MongoDB** for document-based data  
- Learning how to **scale backend systems**
- Studying **real-world application structure and architecture**
- Improving code quality, naming, and separation of concerns
